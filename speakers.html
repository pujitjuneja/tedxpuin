<div class="speakerContL"><span class="speakerName">Vasu Dixit</span><a id="vasu"></a>
<span class="speakerBio">Music is more than just a form of entertainment. It is a form of expression. We've seen numerous examples of this. From John Lennon's Give Peace a Chance to Vande Mataram, written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, music has been known to change the way we look at the world. In the current age of music, where meaningless lyrics and Auto-tune has taken the front seat, some bands, like Swarathma, come across as a welcome change. With songs written to bring about social change, and music which takes you to a different world altogether, they are one of the top bands of the country. One cannot find aany words to describe them. They are simply, Swarathma. Vasu Dixit, their lead vocalist will be a part of this year's event.<br><a href="#top" class="smoothScroll" style="color:#ff2b06; text-decoration:none; font-family:open; text-transform:uppercase;">Back to Top</a></span></div></div><div class="speakerDiv"><img src="images/speakers/HaritSoni.jpg" class="speakerImgR">
